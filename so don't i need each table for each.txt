No, you do not need a separate table for each time slot and day. The relational database design allows you to manage all this within a unified structure. Here's a simplified version of how you can check seat availability using Laravel and Eloquent:

Database Tables
Movies Table

id
title
Other movie-related details...
Seats Table

id
row
number
Other seat-related details...
Time Slots Table

id
movie_id (foreign key to Movies table)
start_time
end_time
date
Seat Time Slot Pivot Table (let's name it seat_time_slot for clarity)

seat_id (foreign key to Seats table)
time_slot_id (foreign key to Time Slots table)
is_booked (boolean)
Querying Seat Availability
Using Eloquent, you would first find the time slot you're interested in, then retrieve all seats related to that time slot, along with their booked status. Here's an example:

php
Copy code
// Assume $timeSlotId is the ID of the time slot you're interested in.
$timeSlot = TimeSlot::with(['seats' => function ($query) {
    $query->select('seats.id', 'row', 'number', 'is_booked')
          ->join('seat_time_slot', 'seats.id', '=', 'seat_time_slot.seat_id')
          ->addSelect('seat_time_slot.is_booked');
}])->find($timeSlotId);
In this example, $timeSlot->seats will give you a collection of seats with their id, row, number, and is_booked status. You can loop through this collection to build your seating chart.

Displaying Seat Availability
When displaying this data on the frontend (like the booking system you've shown in the image), you would use the is_booked status to color the seats accordingly:

If is_booked is true, color the seat red.
If is_booked is false, color the seat green.
Frontend Visualization
In your frontend code (assuming you're using something like JavaScript with a library like Vue.js or React), you would pass the seats data to your component that renders the seating chart. As you render each seat, you would check the is_booked value and apply the appropriate class to change the color of the seat.

javascript
Copy code
// This would be pseudo-code, as the exact implementation would depend on your stack.
seats.map(seat => {
  return (
    <div className={`seat ${seat.is_booked ? 'booked' : 'available'}`} key={seat.id}>
      {seat.number}
    </div>
  );
});
Book a Seat
When a user selects a seat to book it, you would update the is_booked flag in the seat_time_slot table to true for the selected seat and time slot.

php
Copy code
// Inside a transaction to avoid double bookings
DB::transaction(function () use ($seatId, $timeSlotId) {
    $seatTimeSlot = DB::table('seat_time_slot')
                       ->where('seat_id', $seatId)
                       ->where('time_slot_id', $timeSlotId)
                       ->lockForUpdate() // Prevent race condition
                       ->first();

    if (!$seatTimeSlot->is_booked) {
        DB::table('seat_time_slot')
          ->where('seat_id', $seatId)
          ->where('time_slot_id', $timeSlotId)
          ->update(['is_booked' => true]);
    }
});
By using the lockForUpdate() method, you're ensuring that the seat can't be booked by someone else in between the time you check its availability and the time you book it.

This approach keeps your application's data model simple and avoids the complexity and inefficiency of having a separate table for each time slot. Instead, your tables are linked by relationships, and you use these relationships to query and manage the data.
