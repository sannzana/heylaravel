suppose in my laravel project i have 5/6 movies, after choosing any movie, cinema hall will need to be chosen. then option of 2d/3d, date, time need to be chosen along with the seats
it should be made clear, that each movie will have multiple information about it. then it will can not have multiple movie to be played in the same cinema hall at same day, same time
also, there will be 200 seat in each cinema hall and there will be 3 cinema hall. 
each information should be collected to see the income of each day, also admin will have the control of the information, user should also have the option to see their past and present record. how many table need to migrate you think?

To design a Laravel application for booking cinema tickets, where you manage movies, cinema halls, show times, and bookings efficiently, we will need to consider various aspects such as seat availability, show timings, and different movie formats (2D/3D). This design also requires handling user authentication and authorization for different roles (e.g., admin, user).

Here's a suggested database schema that covers all these requirements:

Tables to Migrate
users

Columns: id, name, email, password, role (to distinguish between admin and regular users), etc.
Purpose: To store user credentials and roles.
movies

Columns: id, title, description, duration, release_date, etc.
Purpose: To store information about each movie.
cinema_halls

Columns: id, name, location, capacity (fixed at 200).
Purpose: To store details of each cinema hall.
shows

Columns: id, movie_id, cinema_hall_id, show_date, show_time, format (2D/3D), etc.
Purpose: To link movies with cinema halls and store details about when and how they are shown. Ensure that no two shows overlap in the same cinema hall at the same time.
seats

Columns: id, show_id, seat_number, status (available, booked).
Purpose: To manage seat availability for each show.
bookings

Columns: id, user_id, show_id, booking_time, number_of_seats, total_price, etc.
Purpose: To store user bookings, linking users to the shows they have booked.
transactions (optional, if detailed financial records are needed)

Columns: id, booking_id, transaction_date, amount, payment_method, etc.
Purpose: To store financial transactions related to bookings.
Additional Considerations
Indices and Constraints: You will need to add primary keys, foreign keys, and possibly unique constraints and indexes for performance optimization. For example, a unique index on shows for cinema_hall_id, show_date, and show_time can prevent booking the same hall at the same time for different movies.

Authentication and Authorization: You'll likely use Laravel's built-in Auth system (perhaps with packages like Laravel Breeze or Jetstream) to handle user authentication. For role-based access control, consider a package like Spatieâ€™s Laravel-permission.

Reports and Analytics: To generate reports (like daily income), consider using Laravel's Eloquent models or direct SQL queries to aggregate and compute earnings and other metrics efficiently.

User Interface: For viewing past and current bookings, ensure that the bookings table can be queried efficiently by user_id. The user dashboard can be enhanced using Vue.js or Livewire for a dynamic front-end experience.

This setup should give you a comprehensive system capable of handling your described functionality with the flexibility to expand as new requirements arise.
